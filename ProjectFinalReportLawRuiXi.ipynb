    "- I have learnt how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work harmoniously to be able to display and manipulate web content to the user.\n",
    "- I have learnt the difficulty, alongside with some techniques, to be able to generate better and more aesthethically pleasing webpages, as well as to deliver more functional and intuitive UX than previously.\n",
    "- I have learnt how Jinja2 works with Python's Flask to generate dynamic HTML pages.\n",
    "- I have learnt how Python Flask can communicate with the MySQL server, as well as with the web front-end, to flawlessly deliver a website linked with a database to deliver information as needed to the user.\n",
    "- I have faced some common mistakes made by new web developers, and have learnt how to navigate these issues.\n",
    "- One particular thing that I have discovered while making this webpage is AJAX, while searching for ways to make my website respond smoothly. However, given time constraints of the project, I was unable to learn how to use and thus incorporate AJAX into my web application, and would surely have done so given more time.\n",

    "## Database design\n",
    "I have learnt throughout the project the importance of good database planning. Without having come up with a suitable Entity-Relationship Diagram or Relational Schema, I would not have managed to design a good database, but instead one that is very clunky and hard to ensure basic database principles, like consistency, and hard to make efficient.\n",
    "- I have learnt the importance of ER diagrams in making a database system. By modelling out all the possible entities and relationships before we start, it allows us to better understand the scope of the project.\n",
    "- I have learnt the importance of being able to convert ER Diagrams to Relational Schemas, allowing us to design a database that can faithfully keep track of what we have modelled in the ER Diagram.\n",
    "- I have learnt the importance of Relational Schemas in making a database system, by sorting all the entities and relationships into their respective tables, and deciding on the foreign keys and constraints before we begin designing the database.\n",
    "- My project did not involve normalization, as it was already in 3NF. However, I realize that if my project were different, and the data had not been in 3NF, normalization would be important to ensure no data redundancy and consistency of data across tables.\n",

    "## Future Work\n",
    "This project has certainly helped me learn more about web development and database developement. These lessons would surely help me in the future.\n",
    "- I have learnt about database designs and how to make well-designed ER diagrams and relational schemas for future projects that may involve storage of data.\n",
    "- I have learnt about web development techniques and how to make semi-aesthethically-pleasing webpages for future web-based projects.\n",
    "- In the future, I would probably like to look at some kinds of NoSQL database systems (where applicable) and see how they compare with my current project in ease of use and efficiency."
